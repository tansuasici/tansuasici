## Tansu Aşıcı

I'm a software engineer and PhD candidate in Computer Science from İzmir, Türkiye. I've been building software since 2014 — from student information systems and enterprise applications to B2B e-commerce platforms and mobile apps. Over the years, I've worked across the full stack with .NET, Next.js, and Flutter, and had the chance to lead frontend and mobile teams along the way. Beyond my day job, I love turning rough ideas into working products from scratch.

I'm currently pursuing my PhD at Ege University, researching Agentic AI, LLM Agents, and Multi-Agent Systems. During my master's, I contributed to TÜBİTAK-funded projects in Model Driven Engineering and Domain Specific Languages. When I'm not coding or researching, I enjoy diving into books, collecting interesting things across the web, and capturing moments.
