## Tansu Aşıcı

I'm a [software engineer](https://linkedin.com/in/tansuasici) and PhD candidate from İzmir, Türkiye. I've been building software since 2014 and currently researching AI agents.

I work across the full stack with .NET, Next.js, and Flutter — from enterprise apps and B2B e-commerce to mobile. I've led frontend and mobile teams, and I love turning side ideas into real products.

My PhD at Ege University focuses on Agentic AI, LLM Agents, and Multi-Agent Systems. During my master's, I worked on TÜBİTAK-funded projects in Model Driven Engineering and Domain Specific Languages.

Some of my side projects:

- [MDzen](https://mdzen-74c07.web.app/)
- [Arxivo](https://arxivo-d713a.web.app/)
- [CountryStateCity](https://countrystatecity-aebd6.web.app/)
