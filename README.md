## Tansu Aşıcı

I'm a software engineer and PhD candidate in Computer Science from İzmir, Türkiye — passionate about building things that work and researching what's next. I've been building software since 2014 — from information systems and enterprise apps to leading a frontend and mobile team delivering web and mobile products. Beyond work, I love turning rough ideas into working side projects — it keeps me curious and sharp. On the research side, my PhD focuses on Agentic AI, LLM Agents, and Multi-Agent Systems, exploring how to build smarter, more autonomous software. When I'm not coding, you'll find me diving into books, collecting interesting things across the web, and capturing moments. I’m always open to exploring new opportunities and collaborations.
