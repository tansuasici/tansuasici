### Hi 👋🏻 I'm Tansu Aşıcı

I'm a software engineer and PhD candidate in Computer Science from İzmir, Türkiye — passionate about building things that work and researching what's next.

#### 💻 Software Engineering

I've been building software since 2014 — from student information systems and enterprise applications to B2B e-commerce platforms and mobile apps. Over the years, I've worked across the full stack with technologies like .NET, Next.js, and Flutter, and had the chance to lead frontend and mobile teams along the way.

#### 🧪 Side Projects

Beyond my day job, I love building side projects from scratch. There's something deeply satisfying about taking a rough idea and shaping it into a working product — whether it's a tool that solves a problem I've faced, or just an excuse to experiment with new technologies. These projects keep me curious, push me to learn, and remind me why I love building things.

#### 🎓 Research

I'm pursuing my PhD at Ege University. During my master's, I contributed to TÜBİTAK-funded projects in Model Driven Engineering and Domain Specific Languages. My PhD research explores Agentic AI, LLM Agents, and Multi-Agent Systems — with the goal of building smarter, more autonomous software.

#### 📚 Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, I enjoy diving into books, collecting interesting things across the web, and capturing moments.
